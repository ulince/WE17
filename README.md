This repository contains the code for the individual best bidding strategy.
After cloning the repository, create a directory named "data" at the highest level and save the training, validation and test files there, without changing their names. Then, run the files in src in the following order: Preprocessing-DL.py, Preprocessing-LR.py, Training-DL.ipynb and BestBiddingStrategy.ipynb.
